hi, i'm [Alexandr Chekunkov](https://vk.com/coder_chekunkov), 19 years old programmer from Moskow, Russia. my dream is to create software that will help people do something.
i am always ready to develop and improve my skills in what i like. i take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things i build. i always remember that a cat in gloves catches no mice.

i am also a student at [RTU MIREA](https://www.mirea.ru/). i learn a lot from my fellow thinkers, and i like the way cooperation and knowledge exchange between us goes.

- üíª any business proposal? do reach, email.
